# Meme Generator

## Description

Meme Generator is a web application that enables users to dynamically create and customize memes using the top 100 most popular meme templates. The app retrieves meme templates from an external API, allowing users to add custom text, adjust its position, and see the changes in real time. Additionally, the app supports light and dark display modes to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Meme Customization**: Select from the top 100 meme templates and personalize them with your own text.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Instantly see the changes as you customize the meme.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes to suit your preference.
- **React**: React is the core framework I have used for building the user interface and React Hooks help managing the state and side effects within functional components.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Meme Templates**: The app retrieves the top 100 meme templates from the Imgflip API.
2. **Customize Memes**: Users can add and edit text on the meme templates. The text can be repositioned and resized dynamically.
3. **Real-Time Rendering**: Changes to the meme are rendered in real time, providing instant feedback.
4. **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark modes to improve visibility and comfort.
5. **Responsive Layout**: The application is designed to work smoothly on various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
